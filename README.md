# Multi-Scale-Analysis-of-Quantum-Systems-From-Basics-to-Nanostructures
Conducting an investigation into several quantum phenomena for this study, starting from the basic behaviour of particles in infinite potential wells and 1D atomic chains to the complicated band structures of bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons (AGNR &amp; ZGNR).
